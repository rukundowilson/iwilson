                    <p class="lead-paragraph">
                        Harvard's CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science) is more than just an online course—it's a transformative journey that teaches you how to think like a computer scientist. With 12 challenging problem sets, engaging lectures, and a supportive community, CS50 pushed me to my limits and made me a better developer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the course of several months, I worked through all 12 problem sets, covering everything from C programming and memory management to web development with Python, SQL, and JavaScript. Each problem set was a puzzle that required creativity, persistence, and a willingness to fail—and learn from those failures.
                    </p>

                        If you're serious about learning computer science, CS50 is the best place to start. It's challenging, rewarding, and completely free.

                <h2>What Makes CS50 Special?</h2>
                <p>
                    CS50 isn't just another coding bootcamp or tutorial series. It's a rigorous, university-level course that covers the fundamentals of computer science in depth. You'll learn about algorithms, data structures, memory management, and software engineering principles—concepts that will serve you throughout your entire career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what really sets CS50 apart is its focus on problem-solving. The course doesn't just teach you how to code; it teaches you how to think. Every problem set is designed to challenge you, to make you struggle, and ultimately, to help you grow.
                </p>

                <h2>The 12 Problem Sets: A Journey of Growth</h2>
                <p>
                    The problem sets in CS50 are legendary. They range from simple programs in C to complex web applications, and each one builds on the previous. Here's a glimpse of what you'll tackle:

                <ul style="color: #374151; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Week 0-1:</strong> Scratch and C basics - Learning to think algorithmically</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 2-3:</strong> Arrays and algorithms - Implementing sorting and searching</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Memory - Understanding pointers and dynamic memory allocation</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 5:</strong> Data structures - Building linked lists, hash tables, and tries</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> Python - Transitioning to a higher-level language</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 7:</strong> SQL - Learning database design and queries</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 8:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Building interactive web pages</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 9:</strong> Flask - Creating web applications with Python</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 10:</strong> Final project - Bringing it all together</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Biggest Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    I won't lie—CS50 was hard. There were nights when I stared at my code for hours, trying to figure out why it wasn't working. There were problem sets that made me question whether I was cut out for programming. But every time I pushed through, every time I finally solved a problem that had been stumping me, I felt an incredible sense of accomplishment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the toughest problem sets for me was the "Speller" assignment in Week 5, where you implement a spell checker using a hash table. It required understanding data structures, memory management, and optimization—all at once. But when I finally got it working and saw my code run efficiently, I knew I had leveled up as a developer.
