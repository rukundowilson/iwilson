                    From the moment I could hold a pencil, I've been creating. At just 6 years old, my journey into programming began. Only two weeks after my dad brought home a brand-new HP Elitebook 8460p, I had already taught myself HTML and was writing my first program. Innovation has been my passion ever since.

                <h2>Drawing Has Always Been My First Love</h2>
                <p>
                    Drawing has always been my first love, even more than computers. Surprisingly, it shares many similarities with coding; both require a keen eye for detail, a sense of color and balance, and the patience to correct mistakes until everything still bugs. This artistic perspective has fueled my passion for coding, making every line of code a brushstroke in my digital masterpiece.
                </p>

                <h2>The Joy of Problem-Solving</h2>
                <p>
                    Solving puzzles and tackling mind games like jigsaw puzzles, word games, logic challenges, crosswords, and Sudoku has always been my comfort zone. I vividly remember being 8 years old, unable to put down my mom's cell phone because I had a Sudoku game I could. Even then, problem-solving was my passion, and it has driven me ever since.
                </p>

                <h2>Ready to Make an Impact</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm ready to embark on a career in software engineering. If your team needs a dedicated and skilled developer to drive meaningful change, look no further—I'm your ideal candidate.
                </p>

                <h2>How I Built My First Real-World App Using Node.js & MySQL</h2>
                <p>
                    Building my first production-level application using Node.js and MySQL taught me more than any tutorial ever could. I had to deal with authentication, database design, security concerns, and real user requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest lessons was the importance of clean database schema design: a good schema makes every feature faster to build. Another lesson: never underestimate validation and error handling. The moment real users interact with your system, every missing check becomes a bug.
                </p>

                <h2>My Journey From Blender Experiments to 3D Thinking</h2>
                <p>
                    Before I ever wrote serious code, I was experimenting with Blender. I didn't realize then, but 3D modeling taught me essential problem-solving habits: breaking big tasks into smaller meshes, flipping perspectives, dealing with constraints, and iterating through imperfections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These same skills now help me debug code, design UI flows, and optimize systems. Creativity and logic aren't opposites — they fuel each other.
